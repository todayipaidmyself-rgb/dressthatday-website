            <p>
              <strong>Enquiries:</strong> All bookings are subject to availability. An enquiry does not guarantee a reservation until a deposit has been paid.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Deposit:</strong> A non-refundable deposit is required to secure your event date. The specific amount will be detailed in your quote.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Balance:</strong> The remaining balance is due prior to the event date, typically 2-4 weeks beforehand, as specified in your booking agreement. Failure to pay the balance on time may result in the cancellation of your booking.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Cancellations & Changes</h3>

              <strong>Client Cancellations:</strong> Deposits are non-refundable. Cancellations made within a certain period prior to the event may incur additional charges up to the full value of the booking, to cover costs already incurred.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Changes:</strong> We understand that plans can change. We will do our best to accommodate requested changes to your booking, subject to availability and potential price adjustments.

              <strong>Damage & Loss:</strong> The client is responsible for all hire items during the rental period. Any damage, breakage, or loss of items will be charged to the client at the full replacement cost.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Weather Policy</h3>
            <p>
              For outdoor events, we strongly recommend having a backup indoor location or suitable shelter. We reserve the right to refuse to set up certain items (such as paper decor, delicate props, or electrical equipment) outdoors if weather conditions (rain, strong winds, extreme heat) pose a risk to the items or safety.
